# pacmen

Description of project:

In this project we learned how to create images on demand using javascript, so when the on click event "make one" is pressed, a new pacmen is created and is given a random velociy and position, and moving the pacmen using a forEach function that updates its position on the x and y axis every 20ms. Finally, we detect collision, allowing the pacmen to stay within the browser window.

How to Run:

When you click "Add PacMan" a new pacman should be generated at a random position.

When you click "Start Game", the pacman created should move at a random velcoity and bounce 

Roadmap of future improvements:

As my skills in javascript and css develop, I'd like to make the pacmen be different in size, and have the ability to eat eachother and add in size. The bigger pacman will eat the little one until we run out and have one giant pacman
